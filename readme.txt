Helper plugin to allow reseting WP Full Picture cookie preferences. Use shortcode: [fupi_reset] or [fupi_reset text="Your Custom Text"] in your footer or privacy policy page. Or add 'fupi-reset' class to any element that should trigger the function for reset. Requires WP Full Picture to be enabled and cookie module settings saved to work. Otherwise the shortocode will not output anything. The 'fupi-reset' class trigger requires shortcode to be used on the page at least once (suggestion: footer).
